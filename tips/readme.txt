# Rust Exercises

These sub-projects are based on and slightly adapted from the exercises from [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/).

The suggested order for resolution:
- `expression-evaluation`
- `generic-min`
- `generic-counter`
- `rot-13`
- `protobuf-parsing`
- `gui-modules`
- `luhn-algorithm`
- `parser`

Each of the sub-project has a README suggesting what to do.

The standard Rust library may be useful: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html
