# ROT 13

In this example, you will implement the classic [“ROT13” cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13). Implement the missing bits. Only rotate ASCII alphabetic characters, to ensure the result is still valid UTF-8.

You can play a bit using `cargo run`, and verify if your implementation is good to go using `cargo test`.
